# What are computer registers?
* a group of latches (what's used to store a one bit #) is called a register, which holds a single number
* the number of bits in a register is called it's **width**
* inside the CPU (processor register, CPU register)
* can hold an instruction, store address, or hold any kind of data

# Random notes
* memory address, think like meeting someone at 8th and 12th streets
* need a multiplexor to get address (input/output line)
