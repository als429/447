# Why Binary? (Whynary? lol...)

* Cause it's the easiest thing to implement
* Boolean arithmetic = staightforward
* Everything on a computer is represented in binary


# Positional number systems
* the position of the digit within the number has meaning
* each place has a value (thousandth place, hundredth)
* the digit on the right = least significant (b/c it's lowest value)
* most significant = leftmost (b/c it's the biggest)

## Range
* highest - lower + 1 = inclusive range = # of things in that range
* 10^4 = 10,000
* w/ n digits 10^n different numbers
* largest # is going to be 10^n - 1 (e.g., w/ 4 digits= 9999)

# Numeric bases
* we use a base-10 (decimal) number system
* we can use any #s (even irration number) in a system
* most common bases for computers: base 2 and base 16 (hexidecimal)
* can use base # as subscript after number
  * 5<sub>10</sub> = 101<sub>2</sub>
* Can represent B^n numbers, where n = # of digits
* the largest # is B^n - 1

## Binary
| MSB | 1,024 | 512 | 256 | 128 |  64 |  32 |  16 |  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  | LSB |
|-----|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|-----|
|     |  2^10 | 2^9 | 2^8 | 2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |     |

### Converting to decimals
* Add up the values of the place values, wherever you see a one
 * i.e., you're going to factor out all the zeros
 * multiple place value x the #
 * 1 x # = #, so just ignore 1 x
 * add up the place values

## Converting to binary
* Give as many to each positional group, subtract the rest (think: money/ giving change)
* Biggest (most significant) to lowest (least significance)
* Does _ going into binary positional values?
   * Either yes (1) or no (0)
* If place value < remainder --> digit = 1, remainder = remainder - 1
* 8 bits = 1 byte
* B = bytes 
* b = bit
* Nybble = 4 bits 
* Word = is the most comfortable size of number for a CPU
* 32-bit CPU we mean word size
* Meaning CPU can deal with numbers / arithmetic that is 32 bits long 

### complaints about binary
* Binary is long
* hard to work with for people
* Nice round #s in base ten look arbitrary
* Want a base that is more terse than binary
* The #s that look good in binary, make sense in the new base
* Pick a base that is divisible by 2 
* Our DNA uses base 4 

## Hexadecimal
* base 16
  * 0123456789abcdef
* biggest = 16^digits-1
* ACE = even digits
* 4 bits = 1 nybble = 1 hex digit
* 1 byte = 8 bits = 2 hex digits 
* 32 bits = 8 hex digits
* 0x = common hex notation
