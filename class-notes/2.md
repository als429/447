# Why Binary? (Whynary? lol...)

* Cause it's the easiest thing to implement
* Boolean arithmetic = staightforward
* Everything on a computer is represented in binary


# Positional number systems
* the position of the digit within the number has meaning
* each place has a value (thousandth place, hundredth)
* the digit on the right = least significant (b/c it's lowest value)
* most significant = leftmost (b/c it's the biggest)

## Range
* highest - lower + 1 = inclusive range = # of things in that range
* 10^4 = 10,000
* w/ n digits 10^n different numbers
* largest # is going to be 10^n - 1 (e.g., w/ 4 digits= 9999)
