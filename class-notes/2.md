# Why Binary? (Whynary? lol...)

* Cause it's the easiest thing to implement
* Boolean arithmetic = staightforward
* Everything on a computer is represented in binary


# Positional number systems
* the position of the digit within the number has meaning
* each place has a value (thousandth place, hundredth)
* the digit on the right = least significant (b/c it's lowest value)
* most significant = leftmost (b/c it's the biggest)

## Range
* highest - lower + 1 = inclusive range = # of things in that range
* 10^4 = 10,000
* w/ n digits 10^n different numbers
* largest # is going to be 10^n - 1 (e.g., w/ 4 digits= 9999)

# Numeric bases
* we use a base-10 (decimal) number system
* we can use any #s (even irration number) in a system
* most common bases for computers: base 2 and base 16 (hexidecimal)
* can use base # as subscript after number
  * 5<sub>10</sub> = 101<sub>2</sub>
* Can represent B^n numbers, where n = # of digits
* the largest # is B^n - 1

### Convert
* Add up the values of the place values, wherever you see a one
 * i.e., you're going to factor out all the zeros
 * multiple place value x the #
 * 1 x # = #, so just ignore 1 x
 * add up the place values
