# Control Flow

## Tips
* work from the outside in
* build the framework

## Branches and Blocks
* a basic block is a chunk of code that has no control flow in it
* condition branch instructions:

| Instruction     | Meaning                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| beq a, b, label | if(a == b) { goto label }     |
| bne a, b, label | if(a != b) { goto label }     |
| blt a, b, label | if(a < b)  { goto label }     |
| ble a, b, label | if(a <= b) { goto label }     |
| bgt a, b, label | if(a > b)  { goto label }     |
| bge a, b, label | if(a >= b) { goto label }     |

## Loops + Examples
* infinite loop

```
main_ loop:
  j main_loop # infinite loop
```

* while loop

```
while (s2 < 10) {
  # stuff
  # increment value for condition
}

```
to 

```
cond: 
  blt s2, 10, body
  j end
body: 
  # stuff
  # increment value for condition
  j cond
  
end:
  # more stuff
```

* if function

```
if (s0 == 30){
  # block A
}
# block B
```

to

```
beq s0, 30, blockA
j block B
```


## Tidbits

* Can simplify a conditional branch that ends in a jump

### EXAMPLE 1: 
```
beq s0, 30, blockA
j blockB
 ```

  * 1. invert the condition
  * 2. get rid of the first label.

**UPDATE TO: `bne s0, 30, else`

#### Opposites
| Instruction | Opposite |
|-------------|----------|
| `beq`       | `bne`    |
| `bne`       | `beq`    |
| `blt`       | `bge`    |
| `ble`       | `bgt`    |
| `bgt`       | `ble`    |
| `bge`       | `blt`    |

* syscalls 

```
li v0,11 # prints a character 
syscall 

li v0, 10 # ends the program gracefully
syscall
```

#### short circuit evaluation
* for || (logical OR), if the first condition is true, the second one is skipped. 
* for && (logical AND), if the first condition is false, the second one is skipped.
