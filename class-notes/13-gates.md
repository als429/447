# Gates and Wires

* Circuits we use to implement, the hardware
* What's electricity?
  * protons can't move, electrons can
  * opposites attract
  * squeezing electrons together, they don't want to be together
      * closer you squeeze together, they're less happy :-(  
  * give them a really difficult path out 
  * battery - something that squeezes elections
  * electron shuffle (distance they move = small); but they bump into each other
  * voltage = electron unhappiness
      * higher = more squished
   * current
      * measure of how many electrongs per second are moving past a point
    
 ## Gates
 
* Transitor is like a little value or switch
* input, output, and a control are all single bits
* the bits are represented as voltages 
  * connects its inputs to its output if control is a 1
* we combine transistors in interesting ways to make **gates**
* a gate implements one of the basic boolean logic functions

### NOT gate
* like a sideways girl
* bubble/ head means NOT

### AND gate
* like a D
* round at the end
* A AND 0 = just use 0
* A AND 1 = just use A


### OR gate
* pointed end
* A OR 1 = just use 1
* A OR 0 = just use A

### XOR gate
* exactly one is true (soup or salad)
* pointed
* line before
* not used in practice, like AND, OR, and NOT
* A XOR 0 = just use A
* A XOR 1 = just use not A

### Constants
* You should never have a gate with a constant input

### NAND gate
* NOT AND
* opposite of AND
* D with circle (not) on end
* fastest kind of gate to manufacture
* it is universal
* not can making anything with a NAND gate
* you can build entire circuits
* how they used to build computers
