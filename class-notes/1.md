# Lecture one

* "447 tries to convince you that computers exist." - Dr. Misurda, currently in AZ
* Stuff going on underneath the hood
* 447 and 448 teach things from different angles:
  * data representation
  * memory organization
  * how programs actually run
  * stack/calling conventions
* skills:
  * numerical bases and representation
  * logical operations
  * understanding logic diagrams
  * learning assembly is like a car mechanic learning how an engine runs
  * fundamental things that affect abstraction above
* abstraction = set of lies, built on more lies
* 447 fits into the ISA and logic design  in the "hardware-software" interface
* Topics:
  * ISA, Instruction Set Architecture = programmer's interface to computer hardware
  * logic design
* Microcontrollers:
  * 8/16-bit architecture = still common
  * as little as 32 bytes of memory, only run one, built-in program
  * focus on ultra-low power, cost, and size
  * become more common every day
  * IoT
* Consumer-grade
  * specs:
    * 1-8 cores
    * 32/64 bit architectures
    * MB-GB of memory
    * GB-TB of persistent storage
  * multitasking operating systems
  * focus on real-time user interaction: productivity, media, etc.
* Servers and mainframes
  * focus on real-time delivery - either from storage or after processing
