# Arrays, Control Flow, and Loops

To Do: 

- [ ] check out and play w/ the examples: https://jarrettbillingsley.github.io/teaching/classes/2201/cs0447/examples.html 

## Address Calculation 
* when we want to stor 4-byte values
  * split up across consecutive bytes
* what about a string?
  * how is a string represented?
  * how many bytes is a string? they are variable lenth
* the solution to storing it in memory is the same
* each item is stored as a sequence of bytes
  * how do we acces?
 
 ## What is an array, *really*
 * what memory address is `arry[0]`? F400 in the slides example
 * If X is the memory address, where the array starts (e.g., X = Fx400)
    * X[i] = X + i
    * only part of the answer
 * an int is 4 bytes
 *
