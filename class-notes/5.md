# Arrays, Control Flow, and Loops

**To Do:** 

- [ ] check out, retype, and play w/ the examples: https://jarrettbillingsley.github.io/teaching/classes/2201/cs0447/examples.html 

## Address Calculation 
* when we want to stor 4-byte values
  * split up across consecutive bytes
* what about a string?
  * how is a string represented?
  * how many bytes is a string? they are variable lenth
* the solution to storing it in memory is the same
* each item is stored as a sequence of bytes
  * how do we acces?
 
 ## What is an array, *really*
 * what memory address is `arry[0]`? F400 in the slides example
 * If X is the memory address, where the array starts (e.g., X = Fx400)
    * X[i] = X + b * i (start at the address X and add the offset [i] times the number of b bytes) <-- this is called "scaling"
      * In assembly you have to do the scaling yourself
    * only part of the answer
 * an int is always 4 bytes, one word
 * one word = 4 bytes = 4x8 = 32 bits
 
 ## Having trouble with Mars
 * in command prompt go to folder Mars is downloaded in
 * `java -jar Mars...` hit tab 
 
 # Arrays in MIPS
* Printing values in Array
  * in high level language for loop:

```
for (int i = 0; ; i < length; i++)
  print (data[c])
```
* Information:
  * A = data
  * B = 4
  * i = c (i is the thing within the index, within the brackets)
* **data** is an array of **words**, so how big is each item (B)? 4-bytes
* address of item i = data + (c * 4) 

## Making an array in MIPS

* Step one: make space
  * `little_array: .word 1, 2, 3, 4 # label .data_type stuff, in, array`
  * `big_array: .word 0xBEEFCODE:100 # label .data_type (onehundred copies of BEEFCODE)`
  * side note: `.asciiz` is a data type, it's zero terminating
* Step two: put an address in a register
  * `la t0, little_array # adds the little_array into the register` 
    * `la` stands for "load address", but it's not a load operation... it's weird.
* All together:

```
.data
  little_array: .word 1, 2, 3, 4 # label .data_type stuff, in, array
  big_array: .word 0xBEEFCODE:100 # label .data_type (onehundred copies of BEEFCODE)

.text
 .globl main
 main: 
   la t0, little_array
   

```

## Intermission: Data Transfer
* differ on the size of the integer
* whether the integer is sign extended
 * `li` adds a constant
 * `la` adds a constant address (of an address)
