# Lecture 4 - Memory and Addresses

## REMEMBER
* loads copy from memory to registers
* stores copy from registers to memory
* datapath can access the registers, and does the processing within the processor 

# Memory
## What is the memory?
* Persistent storage = FILES (not what Jarrett is referring to) - big, but slow
  * non-volatile storage
* System memory = running rpograms, variables (small, but faster)
  * system registers are volatile
* Memory = 
  * a big one-dimensional array of bytes
  * what do these bytes mean?
      * ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i dunno lol
  * when each byte has its own address, we call it a byte-addressable machine (could alternatively be a word-addressable <- not common)
  * we do not measure memory data or address in bits
  * the byte is like the atom in the data

## How much memory
* on an n-bit byte-addressable architecture
  * addressses are n-bit numbers*
  * each addresss refers to one byte
  * so how many bytes can your CPU access?
    * n bits
    * 2^n 
    * 2^32 bytes = 4GiB
* prefixes - kilo vs. kibi, mega vs. mebi, giga vs. gibi, tera vs tebi
  * 10^x or 2^x

# Values bigger than a byte
* how do we store words (32-bits)?
  * we make groups 
  * when we load a value, the CPU reassembles the byte into a word
    * the CPU handles this for you
* the address of any value is the address of its first byte

# Endianness
* endianness is a rule for what order to put bytes in large values
* **big-endian convention:** first byte is the **most** significant byte (lowest position # to highest position #), right from left to right
* **little-endian convention:** first byte is the **least** significant byte (highest position # to lowest position #)
  * most CPUs use little endian today...
* what does endianness NOT affect?
  * the arrangement of the bits **within a byte**
  * 1-byte values, arrays of bytes, ASCII strings are NOT affected
  * does not affect the ordering of bytes inside the CPU, no need for "endian" arithmetic 
* only affects moving larger than 1-bytes values, between the CPU and memory or btw multiple computers


## which is better?
* as long as you're consistent, it doesn't matter
* which one is MIPS?
 * it's bi-endian - can work in either configuration
* MARS uses te endiannes of the computer it's running on <- so... little-endian
  
# Variable Addresses 
* *everything* in memory has an address
* SUPER IMPORTANT CONCEPT: every variable really has two parts: an address and a value
  * if you want to create a variable in memory -> first thing you need to give it an address
  * we have our assemblers and compilers do this for us
  
# Load-Store architectures
* in a **load store** architecture, ALL memory accesses are done with two kinds of instructions: laods and stores (like in MIPS)
![]("load-store architecture.png")
  
* so, what three steps are needed to increment that variable?
 1. load the value from memory into a register
 2. add 1 to the value in the register
 3. store the value back into memory
* every variable access works like this!!!
  * high level languages just hide this from you
  
# declaring a variable in memory
 * global
    * in java - `static` 
    * in MIPS
    
      ```
      .data
         x: .word 4       # label type variable
      .text               # use to write instruction
         ...
      
      ```
    * `name:` is a label
    * need the ability to load (`lw`) and store (`sw`) 


* stores **are written with the destination on the right** (only in store instructions)
* 

```
.data
  x: .word 4       # label type variable
  

.text
  globl main.
   main:
     # x++
     lw t0, x            # load x into a register call
     add t0, t0, 1       # incrementing t0 by 1; t0 = t0 + 1
     sw t0, x            # updates the value of x to +1 in memory (stores copy from registers to memory)
```
