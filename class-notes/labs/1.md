# Lab #1 Notes
*Note: No lab answers are here, just Jarrett's notes pulled out.*

## Main 
* Need `globl` directive for main function
* `main:` is a label (for functions)
```
.globl main
main:
```

* `li` stands for "load immediate" and adds a constant value to the register
* `a0` is an argument register
  * When you put things in an argument register, you know things are going to happen in the function call
* `syscall` stands for "system call"
  * We can't tell it which system to call, so we load it into a register (`v0`)
  
```
 li	a0, 1234
 li	v0, 1
 syscall
 ```
 
## Making a function
* use the `function_name:` syntax
* function must end in `jr ra`, which is basically the `return;` instruction
  * So when you make a function, write the `jr ra` first so you wonâ€™t forget
* `jal` stands for "jump and link" and is used for calling functions

```
jal	print_int
```

## Printing a string
* to print a string into memory, we must switch to the data segment 
* the `.data` and `.text` directives tell the assembler to switch to the data and text (code) segments. 
  * any time you switch to the data segment, you must switch back to the `.text` segment to write more code.
  
```
 .data
 hello_message: .asciiz "Hello, world!"

 .text # must have this to write more code below!
 ```

* `la` stands for "load address", which we need to use for strings

```
  la a0, hello_message
  jal print_string
 ```
 
## Nested function calls
* why `push ra` and `pop ra`?
  * `ra` is like a bookmark that the CPU uses (to get back to where it was, of course!)
  * but when you `jal print_int` inside of `print_123` (i.e., another function, nested), `ra` is replaced by a bookmark back to `print_123`
  * so the `jr ra` at the end of `print_123` just kept going back to the print_123, forever.
  * pushing and popping ra inside `print_123` lets us save the bookmark to `main` on the stack.
  
```
 print_123:
     push	ra # let's us save the bookmark to main on the stack

     #...the calls to print_int, but NOT the jr ra

     pop	ra # let's us save the bookmark to main on the stack
     jr		ra # if you don't include the push and pop, this jr ra recursively loops...forever...
 ```
