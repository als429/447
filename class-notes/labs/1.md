# Lab #1 Notes
*Note: No lab answers are here, just Jarrett's notes pulled out.*

## Main 
* Need `globl` directive for main function
* `main:` is a label (for functions)
```
.globl main
main:
```

* `li` stands for "load immediate" and adds a constant value to the register
* `a0` is an argument register
  * When you put things in an argument register, you know things are going to happen in the function call
* `syscall` stands for "system call"
  * We can't tell it which system to call, so we load it into a register (`v0`)
  
```
 li	a0, 1234
 li	v0, 1
 syscall
 ```
 
## Making a function
* use the `function_name:` syntax
* function must end in `jr ra`, which is basically the `return;` instruction
  * So when you make a function, write the `jr ra` first so you wonâ€™t forget
* `jal` stands for "jump and link" and is used for calling functions

```
jal	print_int
```

## Printing a string
* to print a string into memory, we must switch to the data segment 
* the `.data` and `.text` directives tell the assembler to switch to the data and text (code) segments. 
  * any time you switch to the data segment, you must switch back to the `.text` segment to write more code.
  
```
 .data
 hello_message: .asciiz "Hello, world!"

 .text # must have this to write more code below!
 ```

* `la` stands for "load address", which we need to use for strings

```
  la a0, hello_message
  jal print_string
 ```
 
## Nested function calls
* why `push ra` and `pop ra`?
  * `ra` is like a bookmark that the CPU uses (to get back to where it was, of course!)
  * but when you `jal print_int` inside of `print_123` (i.e., another function, nested), `ra` is replaced by a bookmark back to `print_123`
  * so the `jr ra` at the end of `print_123` just kept going back to the print_123, forever.
  * pushing and popping ra inside `print_123` lets us save the bookmark to `main` on the stack.
  
```
 print_123:
     push	ra # let's us save the bookmark to main on the stack

     #...the calls to print_int, but NOT the jr ra

     pop	ra # let's us save the bookmark to main on the stack
     jr		ra # if you don't include the push and pop, this jr ra recursively loops...forever...
 ```

# Additional Notes
* How to do a procedure call
 * Transfer control to the callee (called method) to start the procedure
  * `jal function_name`
   * keeps track of the instruction *afer* the `jal`, so we can continue in the right place when we are done with the procedure
 * Return control to the caller when the procedure is done
  * `jr $ra`
* `syscall`? makes a request of the operating sustem, frequently I/O operations
  * User code and kernel
* label
 * can call your labels whatever you want, but they are case sensitive
   ```
   .text
   main:
   la $a0, Bob # load Bob/data address into a0 (data segment); a0 contains the ADDRESS
   la $t0, Steve
   
   li $v0, 4 # load v0 with the value 4
   syscall # whatever string is in a0 it will print; will print "My name is Bob."
   
   move $a0, $t0 # update a0 to be Steve
   li $v0, 4
   syscall  # should print "My name is Steve."
   
   li $v0, 10 # load v0 with the value to 10 
   syscall
   
   .data
   Bob: .asciiz "My name is Bob."
   Steve: .asciiz "My name is Steve."
   ```
* in MIPS people say "procedure" versus function or method

```
.data
  message: .asciiz "Hi" # label = name with a colon
.text
  main:
   # how do you use the procedure? --> jal
   jal displayMessage
   # will return here after the procedure is complete
  
   li $v0, 10 # tell the system that the program is done; without it will infinitely recurse
   syscall
 
  displayMessage:
   li $v0, 4
   la $a0, message
   syscall
   
   jr $ra # go back to the method that called you
 ```
* Passing argument values

```
.data

.text 
 main:
 
 # how do we add parameters? -> put values in a0+ registers!!!
 
  addi $a1, $zero, 50
  addi 4s2, $zero, 10
  jal addNums
  
  # print value
  li $v0, 1
  addi $a0, $v0, 0
  syscall
  
  # tell the system that the procedure is done
   li $v0, 10
   syscall
  
addNums:
# v1 is for return values!!!
 add $v1, $a1, $a2 # add value in a1 and a2
 jr $ra # go back to the calling place

```
