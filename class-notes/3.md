# Lecture 3 - Programs, Instruction, Registers

## Important to remember
* 8 bits = 1 byte
* a byte  = 2 hex digits
* loads copy from memory to registers
* stores copy from registers to memory

## Basic definitions
* an instruction is a single operation (i.e., step) for the computer to do
* a program is a series of these tiny instructions
* machine language instructions are the pattersn of bits that a processor reads to know what to do 
* assembly language is a human-readable, textual representation 
  * encoded as a 32 bit 
  
## Compilers
* convert source code into object files
 * object files - contain files
 * shove the object file to a linker, which makes the executable
* executbable = what is it, how big is it, what types of features does it use and require

## Virutal Machines
* Split the compiler and linker, and add an extra step
* Intermediate language code = microsoft's name
* virtual machine finishes the job, takes the intermediate code and makes it into machine code
 * usually with a JIT (just-in-time compiler)
* same basic concept as a compile, plus an extra layer
